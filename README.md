## Notes

Some challenges, I've had during the process of creating the app was discovering some code steps such as the var BillAmount with the Object C
code that was a bit troubling at first due to it seeing it as an error. But, after some research, the help of Katherine from CCSF 
comment to another student who had the same issue and asking, I was able to overcome part of it. The other solution came from reading out the 
error comments given by Xcode. It was due to the changes to the program that the video of creating a tip calculator that it did not change 
because it was made a few years before the changes of the var used a few years ago that was not done with the command let billAmount. Overall,
I learned even with challenges there's always a solution. It just requires patience, asking others, researching and what reading the comments 
from the program/software itself can help to solving and overcoming the challenges.
